Ideas to the code

- Have a clock with a player counter
- Dont wait for clock beats, but when you get a player do not move it before you can receive a clock beat, ie wait one the clock and you input (to reject others)
- When a player walks off board inform the clock so it can decrement its counter
- when the injector adds players, inform the clock so it can increment its counter,
- this could be done also by the cells
- create a enum with commands in a seperate file
